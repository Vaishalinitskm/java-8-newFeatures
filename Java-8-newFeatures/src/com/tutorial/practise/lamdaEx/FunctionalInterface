To be able to call the lamda expressions, 
we need something called functional interfaces

A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. 
They can have only one functionality to exhibit
A functional interface can have any number of default methods( or static methods). 


Runnable, ActionListener, Comparable, Callable
are some of the examples of functional interfaces.

Runnable ->   run() method
Callable -> call() method
ActionListener -> actionPerformed() method
Comparable ->  compareTo() method
